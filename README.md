# household_speaker_recognition

This is the baseline system for household speaker recognition. 

Code in this repo is subjected to baseline experiments with limited number of protocols. Therefore, it needs re-factoring as the research proceeds.

## Usage

1. How to use the code
2. How to modify the code (for users, coming soon): initiate functions and classes
3. De-factorize the main script

### Pre-requisites


### Runner
Please run `python3 household_simulation.py`.



## Features

### Semi-supervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning
